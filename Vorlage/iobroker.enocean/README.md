## Compatible USB Sticks & Modules
USB300

DOSMUNG USB Stick with SMA port - [Buy](https://amzn.to/33EapbN)

FAM-USB (ESP3 Firmware)

EnOcean Pi Modul

Eltako FGW14:  
You have to enable ESP2 mode in the adapter config, to use the FGW14.  
**Important Notes**: This gateway does not support all features and devices of this adapter.  Known features that does not work: RSSI, Gateway information can not be read and only RS485 Bus devices can be controlled without FTD14 (not tested yet).  If there is no technical reason to use this gateway it is highly recomended to use an other one.  

ALL SMART EnOcean LAN Gateway - [BUY](https://www.all-smart.net/produkt/all-smart-enocean-lan-gateway/)

## Control devices
In general there is a cmd object where you can choose the command that you want to execute. Before you can execute a command you have to set all attributes that are necessary, 
you can find this information in the profile definition.

Special:
* A5-20-xx: Devices with this profile does only accept commands within 1 second after they have sent a message. They send periodically (10 minutes?), please read the manual.


## Teach-in
- The process is documented with (short) step-by-step instructions in the adapter configuration. There you can Choose
  your device and the instructions will be displayed. Follow them.
- Devices without possibility to teach-in to an other device (like Eltako Series 12 also known as Opus Green Net): 
They can be controlled with an virtual switch (F6-02-02): Open configuration and click add new device. 
Now choose X_Virtual as manufacturer and Switch as device, use ID fffffff0. Count up the last sign, 1-9 and a-f, for each new virtual switch.
Click add device and close configuration. Then start teach-in on your device according to the manual, send command from virtual switch.
Now you should be able to control the device.

## Teach-out (delete adapter binding from the device)
- Eltako Tipp-Funk: Send 3 times teach-in command during 2 seconds from ioBroker to device
- Devices with UTE: Start Teach-in for the adapter and follow the device instructions.
- RPS: Just delete the obejcts
- none: Just delete the objects

## Troubleshooting
- Device does not react to command: Open the device Object in the Object tab, go to native and look if there are more than one EEPs registered. 
If yes the first one has to be the one that will control the device. 


## Profile definition file

#### Data structure

***case:*** Could be a single element or an array, that holds a set of datafields. In case of an array the element is bound to an condition.

***send:*** true means this set of data is a command that will be sent to the device.

***auto_answer:*** true means this command will be executed after receiving a telegram from the device.

***condition:*** The condition which has to be true that this set of datafields is processesd. In the most cases the condition is a specific value from the data package.

***datafield:*** Information where in the data package the data are and how to handle the value. Also there is the object definiton for ioBroker.

***datafield -> secondArgument:*** Used to get a secondary infromation/value from the data package. Use case: Units can vary on their amount, so the device sends the unit as a seperate information. 
To change the unit inside ioBroker depending on the sent information, it is necessary to know this while processing the value.

***datafield -> condition:*** This could be a formula to convert a value. This is based on JSON-logic for detailed information
refer to  http://jsonlogic.com/operations.html. 

Example: 

```
//True or false
"==": [{"var": "value"}, 0]

//This will take the delivered value and check if it is equal to 0, if it is the state in iobroker will set to true.
```

***datafield -> value:*** This represents the value that is given back, except the condition is the output value. Than value should not be defined.

Example:

```
//Temperature conversion from received data
 "+": [{
         "*": [
              { "-": [{"var": "value"}, 0] },
              0.2
            ]}, 0]

//This is a more complex looking formula.
//It is based on this one: Device Value = Multiplier * ( rawValue - Range min) + Scale min
//The Multiplier, in this case 0.2, is calculated in this way: (Scale max - Scale min) / (Range max - Range min)
```

***datafield -> value_out:*** This represents the value that will be sent to the device. This has only to be defined if a conversion is needed.

Example:

```
//Temperature conversion from ioBroker
 "/": [{
         "+": [
              { "-": [{"var": "value"}, 0] },
              0
            ]}, 0.2]

//This is a more complex looking formula.
//It is based on this one: Device Value = ( ( rawValue - Range min) + Scale min ) / Multiplier
//The Multiplier, in this case 0.2, is calculated in this way: (Scale max - Scale min) / (Range max - Range min)
```

***datafield -> decimals:*** Defines how many digits after decimal point will be shown. 

***datafield -> unit:*** Use this if the Unit is variable otherwise define it in iobroker.

Example:
```
//Choose between Watt(W) and Kilowatt(kW) depending on the unit information from the device
 "unit":{
            "if": [
              {"==":[{"var": "value2"}, 3]}, "W",
              {"==":[{"var": "value2"}, 4]}, "kW"
            ]
          }

//value2 comes from secondArgument. 
```

## Device definition

The full implementation of a device consists minimum of two parts: A entry in 'lib/definitions/devices.json' and a EEP file, 
which defines the objects and how to handle the data telegram.
There are devices which uses more than one data telegram type to communicate, this means they have more EEP files.  
In special cases, as Eltako, there is also a manufacturer specific part in the 'packet_handler.js' defined.

```
"Model name or type" : {
      "EEP": [                    //The EEP(s) that will be used for this device. First one has to be the one that controlls the device.
        "TF-13-07",
        "TF-13-06"
      ],
      "autocreate": false,         //false if the device needs additional steps for teachin
      "teachin_method": "none",    //filter for automated teachin telegrams
      "id_offset": true,           //not all devices checks if the telegram whether it is for them
      "broadcast": false,          //true if the receiver id has to be ffffffff. This is used for virtual devices like a switch.
      "help": {                    //a step by step instruction how to add the device.
        "en": {
          "1": "Enter device ID.",
          "2": "Click on 'Add Device'."
        },
        "de": {
          "1": "Geräte ID eintragen.",
          "2": "Auf 'Gerät Hinzufügen' klicken."
        }
      }
    }
```

## For development
To test telegram handling create a channel with name development and in this channel a object with name telegram, type string.
